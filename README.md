# Atlassian MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Atlassian integration that helps engineers manage their CPPF â†’ CRE workflow.

## Overview

This MCP server provides tools for:
- Sprint planning and management
- CPPF ticket analysis
- CRE story and task creation
- Task prioritization and recommendations
- Status reporting and communication

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/atlassian-mcp.git
cd atlassian-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your Atlassian credentials and configuration.

## Configuration

The following environment variables are required:

- `JIRA_EMAIL`: Your Atlassian account email
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: Your Atlassian API token (create at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
- `USER_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Atlassian account ID

Additional configuration options:
- `JIRA_HOST`: Your Atlassian instance hostname (default: company.atlassian.net)
- `JIRA_CPPF_PROJECT`: CPPF project key (default: CPPF)
- `JIRA_CRE_PROJECT`: CRE project key (default: CRE)
- `CONFLUENCE_HOST`: Your Confluence instance hostname (default: company.atlassian.net)
- `CONFLUENCE_SPACES`: Comma-separated list of Confluence spaces to search (default: PROD,ENG,DESIGN)
- `SPRINT_PLANNING_SPACE`: Confluence space for sprint planning files (default: ~629041681a437e007044041e)
- `USER_ROLE`: Your engineering role (web, backend, app, ios, fullstack) (default: fullstack)
- `CURRENT_SPRINT`: Current sprint name (default: Sprint 24)
- `PLATFORMS`: Comma-separated list of platforms (default: web,backend,app,ios)

## Usage

Start the MCP server locally:

```bash
pnpm start
```

The server will start and listen for MCP requests.

## Build and Deploy

To build the project for deployment to the MCP host:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will create optimized production files in the `dist` directory. 

### Using in MCP Host

After building, the build files can be used directly in the MCP host without requiring a running server. This allows for:

1. **Direct Integration**: The MCP host can load the build files directly
2. **Improved Performance**: Optimized build has better performance
3. **Simplified Deployment**: No need to maintain a separate server instance

To deploy to the MCP host, follow these steps:

1. Build the project as described above
2. Copy or upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your MCP host
3. Configure the MCP host to use the uploaded files

For more information on MCP host configuration, consult the MCP host documentation.
